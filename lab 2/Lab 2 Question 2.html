     <p>After stealing the Tesseract during the events of Avengers: Endgame (2019), 
        an alternate version of Loki is brought to the mysterious Time Variance Authority (TVA), 
        a bureaucratic organization that exists outside of time and space and monitors the timeline. 
        They give Loki a choice: face being erased from existence due to being a "time-variant", 
        or help fix the timeline and stop a greater threat. Loki ends up in his own crime thriller, 
        traveling through time, hunting a female version of himself named Sylvie.</p><br>
